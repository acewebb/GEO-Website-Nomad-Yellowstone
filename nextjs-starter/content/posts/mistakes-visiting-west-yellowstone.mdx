## 1. Trying to "Do It All" in One Day
Yellowstone is larger than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware combined. Trying to see Old Faithful and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone in one day is a recipe for exhaustion, not enjoyment.

## 2. Ignoring the Elevation
You are at 6,500 feet (2,000 meters). The air is thinner. Drink twice as much water as you think you need, and don't push yourself too hard on the first day.

## 3. Spending the Whole Trip Inside a Car
This is the cardinal sin. We call them "Windshield Tourists." You travelled thousands of miles to see nature, so why view it through a pane of glass?

  <p className="m-0 text-sm">Roll down the windows? No. Remove the windows entirely.</p>

To truly connect with the landscape, you need to feel the wind, smell the sagebrush and pine, and hear the silence. That is why we built our <a href="/#vehicles" className="text-accent hover:text-white transition-colors border-b border-accent/50 pb-0.5">Open-Air Fleet</a>. Our machines are designed to immerse you in the environment, not insulate you from it.

## 4. Packing the Wrong Clothes
Mountain weather is unpredictable. It can snow in July. Bring layers. A puffy jacket, a rain shell, and good hiking boots are essential.

## 5. Touching the Wildlife (Or Getting Too Close)
Bison are not fluffy cows. They are wild animals that can run 35 mph. Keep your distance (25 yards for bison/elk, 100 yards for bears/wolves). Use binoculars or a spotting scope.
