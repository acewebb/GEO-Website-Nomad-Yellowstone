## Day 1: The Standards (With a Twist)
Start your morning early—6:00 AM early. Hit **Old Faithful** before the tour buses arrive. Walk the boardwalks in the cool morning air when the steam is thickest and the crowds are thinnest.

  <p className="m-0 text-sm">Parking at Midway Geyser Basin fills up by 9:00 AM. Go there immediately after Old Faithful.</p>

After the geysers, head north to **Mammoth Hot Springs**. The terraced limestone formations are otherworldly. Grab lunch at the Mammoth Hotel dining room for a touch of history.

## Day 2: The Escape
This is where most tourists get it wrong. They get stuck in "bear jams" in Hayden Valley. You are going to do something different. You are going to the **Continental Divide**.

To truly see the scale of this ecosystem, you need elevation, and you need to leave the pavement behind.

Our **Morning Scout Expedition** takes you high above the tree line. No crowds, no glass windows—just 360-degree views of the Tetons, the Centennial Range, and the vast caldera. This is the Yellowstone the pioneers saw.

## Day 3: Water & Woods
Decompress on your final day. Head to **Mesa Falls** (technically in the Targhee National Forest, just outside the park). The power of the Upper Falls is mesmerizing, and the boardwalks put you right over the edge.

  <p className="m-0 text-sm">Stop at Big Springs to feed the massive trout from the bridge. It’s a classic Island Park tradition.</p>

Finish your trip with a float down the Henry's Fork or a quiet dinner in West Yellowstone. You've seen the icons, you've escaped the crowds, and you've breathed the air. Mission accomplished.
