## 1. Big Springs
One of the largest natural springs in the world, pumping out 120 million gallons of crystal-clear water every day. It's the headwaters of the Henry's Fork.

  <p className="m-0 text-sm">Rent a raft and float from Big Springs to Mack's Inn. It’s a gentle, 3-hour drift through moose country.</p>

## 2. The Continental Divide Ridge
Most people see the divide from a highway sign. Few stand on top of it. This rugged spine offers views into both Idaho and Montana.

The only way to comfortably reach the best viewpoints is via a guided off-road tour. Our <a href="/expeditions" className="text-nomad-red hover:text-white transition-colors border-b border-nomad-red/50 pb-0.5">Morning Scout Expedition</a> navigates the technical terrain for you, delivering you to a summit few eyes ever see.

## 3. Johnny Sack Cabin
Located at Big Springs, this historic cabin is a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Built in the 1930s, every piece of furniture, the lamps, and even the ceiling texture was hand-crafted from bark and wood by Johnny Sack himself.

## 4. Mesa Falls Nature Trail
Skip the main overlook for a moment and take the nature trail. It’s a quiet one-mile loop that takes you through the quiet forest before revealing the thunderous power of the Lower Falls.

## 5. Sunset Peak (The Golden Hour)
Watching the sun dip below the horizon from 9,000 feet is a spiritual experience. The colors shift from gold to violet, and the silence is absolute.
